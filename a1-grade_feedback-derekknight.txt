-----
(1) route_manager.c submitted and named appropriately; compiles
    without errors or warnings.

- Yes, the submitted file is correct, and the code
  compiles successfully without errors or warnings.

-----
(2) Tests passed (and further comments)

- All tests failed. The code does not produce output.txt.

-----
(3) Code formatting and structure:

 Positive aspects:

- Good formatting and structure of the code that facilitates reading
  and understanding.

- Good naming conventions for functions and variables.

- Great attempt at documenting the code using comments to describe
  important aspects of the solution.

- Reasonable attempt at code segmentation (i.e., appropriate function
  creation and use). Consider dividing large functions into various
  smaller functions with a smaller scope and a well-defined purpose.

Improvement opportunities:

- Instead of having large functions, it is a good practice to divide
  your program into small pieces of functionality defined in
  well-defined functions. Functions should have a unique intention and a
  very clear scope. This facilitates the re-usability and maintainability
  of your code.
